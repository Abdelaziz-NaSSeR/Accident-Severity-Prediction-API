# Accident-Severity-Prediction-API-FastAPI

A FastAPI-based machine learning model that predicts accident severity based on various input features. The API processes accident-related data and returns severity predictions.

# 🚗 Accident Severity Prediction API (FastAPI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model** to predict accident severity based on various input features. The model is deployed using **FastAPI**, allowing users to send requests with accident-related data and receive severity predictions.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The model is trained using accident-related data with the following features:
- **Number of Vehicles**
- **Time (24hr)**
- **1st Road Class**
- **Road Surface**
- **Lighting Conditions**
- **Weather Conditions**
- **Casualty Severity**
- **Sex of Casualty**
- **Age of Casualty**
- **Type of Vehicle**
- **Age Group**
- **Vehicle Group**
